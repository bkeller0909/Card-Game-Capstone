## Overview 

Grasping Chaos is set in a world full of conflict of power. A council of magical beings performs great rituals every blue moon. These rituals decide a grandmaster who will hold power over the realm. The title of grandmaster is not given but taken through magical heretic combat. The Beings will put their life forces on the line to achieve the title of grandmaster and seek true power. In Grasping Chaos players take control of two powerful magic beings. Utilising strategy, wits, and skills. They aim to defeat their opponent by casting a variety of spells. Spell casting is done through quick time events that test a players accuracy, precision and the ability to stay calm under pressure.
