# Game Dev Captstone Project - Grasping Chaos

Grasping Chaos is a round based strategy deck builder being developed by student Game Dev group called Pack Rats Studios. Grasping Chaos aims to merge the card game genres of roguelike deck building and strategy. We draw inspiration from popular tabletop and digital card games.
