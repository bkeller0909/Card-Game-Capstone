# Game Dev Captstone Project - Grasping Chaos

Grasping Chaos is a strategic, action, round based card game where players duel as skeletal mages, with the goal of destroying your opponents life force. Your life force are your fingers...Lose a bone, and lose your grip on victory! Outsmart your opponent with spell cards, and be the last one remaining. ðŸ’€

This game was made in 4 months by a student game dev team as part of a capstone project .
