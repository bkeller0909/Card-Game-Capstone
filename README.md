# Grasping Chaos

**Grasping Chaos** is a **strategic, round-based action card game** where players duel as skeletal mages with each trying to shatter the other's life force.

Your life force? Your **fingers**. Lose a bone, and lose your grip on victory! ☠️  
Outsmart your opponent using spell cards, mind games, and magical rings to emerge victorious in the skeletal standoff.

## Strategy Meets Reflex

Choose wisely — your card combos and timing can turn the tide. Rings grant passive bonuses, so play offensively or defensively based on the state of the duel.
